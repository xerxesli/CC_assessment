Hi,

I am sorry that the work is incomplete due to unfamiliarity with the area and the release schedule of my department.

part1:
The document "part1\test_case_part1.xlsx" listed the items I decide to test.
It covered feature, boundary, stress, performance and security tests.
But the test script is only implemented for 2 cases: basic GET and POST method.
The script "part1/run_test1.js" can be run in Node.js 14.

part2:
The document "part2\test_case_part2.xlsx" listed the test items for the 6 scenarios, which planned to use Selenium for testing.
The "part2\bugs.xlsx" list some bugs for the JPetStore.
But the automation script is not implemented yet.
